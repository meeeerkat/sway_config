### Custom xkb keymap for the broken keyboard
# Don't bother with higher level stuff given by sway, the special keys seem
# complex to override.
# For a non-broken keyboard, maybe use /old/custom_fr_keymap ?
input "type:keyboard" {
    xkb_file ~/.config/xkb/custom
}

### Bindsym for navigation
# Overriding what is in the default config since it doesn't seem to work
# (maybe because the input xkb file wasn't set when the bindings were made ?)
bindsym $mod+Left focus left
bindsym $mod+Down focus down
bindsym $mod+Up focus up
bindsym $mod+Right focus right

bindsym $mod+Shift+Left move left
bindsym $mod+Shift+Down move down
bindsym $mod+Shift+Up move up
bindsym $mod+Shift+Right move right
